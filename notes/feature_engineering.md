#### Transforming numerical values

- Helps to contain outliers

- Tree based models are scale invariant


### Misc Notes

Rare values tend to have similar counts (with values like 1 or 2), so you can classify rare values together at prediction time. Common values with large counts are unlikely to have the same exact count as other values. So, the common/important values get their own grouping.
