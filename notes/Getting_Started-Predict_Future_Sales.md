# Predict Future Sales: Getting Started

This writeup is to help an absolute beginner get started on Kaggle using the Kaggle Project: [Predict Future Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales)

First thing I would recommend is doing a few of the Kaggle Courses

- [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)
- [Intermediate Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning)

If you're learning Python, there are lots of resources on the Internet but these two Kaggle courses with get you started

-[Python](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)
-[Pandas](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas)

## Exporatory Data Analysis - EDA

The first task is to learn about the data.  Under the [Code Tab](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/code) you can search the public notebooks for the term 'eda'.  It's usually best to begin with the most upvoted notebooks

Here are my first 3 search results:

- https://www.kaggle.com/dimitreoliveira/model-stacking-feature-engineering-and-eda
- https://www.kaggle.com/python10pm/future-sales-part-i-eda
- https://www.kaggle.com/kabure/simple-eda-model-hyperopt-w-easy-code

All of these notebooks will:

1. Explain the goal
2. Examine all the fields/features
3. Look for missing data
4. Provide lots of charts to visualize the data

## Read the Previous Discussions

Spend a few minutes looking at previous discussions on the competition.

Sort by Recent or Votes then skip through the headlines.  If you run into a problem later, the answer may be in a previous discussion.
